            <h2>What are structured wiring solutions?</h2> 

            <p>There is so much new technology available to organizations that can increase productivity and make operations run smoother. Technology is constantly developing and changing, which means you need a team that stays up-to-date with the latest trends and information to help your organization run at its best for IT solutions.</p>

            <p>Structured writing solutions (sometimes called structured cabling solutions) is one service we offer which allows for an IT infrastructure that comprises smaller, standardized elements on your organization’s campus. With the movement to new technology, software, and equipment needed for remote work in the changing workplace landscape, having a structured wiring solution means your organization can get work done quicker.</p> 

            <p>The structured wiring lays the perfect foundation for the constantly growing technology that is available to us. New equipment and software makes getting things done easier—and with the right infrastructure, you can move to new systems and new technology quicker and with fewer obstacles.</p>

            <p>Before, point-to–point wiring was used to build an organization’s IT infrastructure. With this kind of technique, each piece of hardware has its own corresponding cable. This leads to a mess of wires, which means not only a more difficult time with keeping things organized but also risking accidentally unplugging the wrong wire. Organizations with this kind of infrastructure also had to worry about an increased risk of safety hazards with tripping.</p>

            <p>This new cabling system allows for a cleaner and simpler way to keep wires organized and also supports the increasing demand for data and bandwidth for business operations. Structured wiring solutions also help lay the right infrastructure to keep your business strengthening in technology and innovation.</p>

            <h2>What does the term “structured wiring solutions” encompass?</h2>

            <p>When you first hear the words “structured wiring,” you may think only about the literal wires that are a part of your IT infrastructure–but it goes way beyond that. We are referring to several dedicated areas throughout your organization’s building or campus.</p>

            <h2>The six smaller subsystems of a structured cabling system include:</h2>

            <h3>Entrance Facilities (EF):</h3>
            <p>This subsystem includes cables, network demarcation point(s), connecting hardware, protection devices and other equipment that connect to the access provider (AP) or private network cabling.</p>

            <h3>Equipment Room (ER):</h3>
            <p>A centralized space containing the main cross-connect (MC) [Distributor C], intermediate cross-connects (ICs) [Distributor B], horizontal cross-connects (HCs) [Distributor A], or both.</p>

            <h3>Backbone Cabling:</h3>
            <p>Allows for the interconnection between the following components: telecommunications rooms, equipment rooms, access provider (AP) spaces and entrance facilities.</p>

            <h3>Telecommunications Room (TR) & Telecommunications Enclosure (TE):</h3>
            <p>Contains the terminations of horizontal and backbone cables to connect hardware.</p> 

            <h3>Horizontal Cabling–(Cabling Subsystem 1):</h3>
            <p>Connects telecommunications rooms to individual outlets or work areas on the floor through the wireways, conduits, or ceiling spaces of each floor.</p>

            <h3>Work Area (WA):</h3>
            <p>Connects end-user equipment (such as computer workstations) to outlets of the horizontal cabling system.</p> 

            <h2>Benefits of Structured Wiring Solutions</h2>  

            <p>There are several benefits to implementing structured writing at your organization. It is more cost effective, less time-consuming, and reduces the risk of downtime when compared to traditional point-to-point cabling. It is more cost effective because it reduces power and maintenance costs.</p> 

            <p>Another way that structured cabling can help with cost savings is by increasing airflow. When point-to-point systems are used, there is so much congestion with the amount of wires used it can affect the airflow that the switch requires to operate. When there is not enough airflow, it can cause cooling issues, which can cost your business money to fix. The blocked airflow from cabling congestion obstructs the airflow of the computer room air conditioning (CRAC).</p>

            <p>Structured wiring also helps reduce the risk of downtime by decreasing the risk of human error associated with managing multiple cables. This old infrastructure causes more disorganization and more confusion, which can lead to more issues. By investing in structured wiring solutions for your business, cable and port tracing becomes much easier and saves time. Your IT team can focus on other important tasks at hand that affect core business functions, and spend less time tracking down issues with a more logical and organized structured wiring infrastructure.</p>

            <p>By switching over to structured wiring, your business will have an easier time with moves, adds, and changes. Switching over also allows for your wiring system to look cleaner and more organized than the traditional point-to-point system. This will just overall help the look of your system to be more aesthetically pleasing and organized.</p>

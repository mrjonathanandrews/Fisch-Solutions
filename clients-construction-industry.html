            What are managed IT services? 

            Managed IT services allow an organization of any size to outsource information technology (IT) to an external Managed IT Services Provider. Working with a managed IT services provider means more time and resources to focus on the core functions of a construction management company and its client projects. Outsourcing managed IT services also allows clients in the construction industry to focus on payment collection, project management, collaboration, planning, and execution. 

            

            A difference between an IT managed service provider and a traditional IT department is that the managed services provider makes strategic decisions regarding IT needs and proactively presents them to the client. In this model, the managed services provider provides solutions to the client, acting as a consultant to guide organizations to make the best choices regarding IT related to their unique business needs and goals. 

            

            An IT managed services provider's role in an organization is determined by many different factors, including the client industry, business needs and goals, current infrastructure, and any compliance/security measures specific to that industry.  

            

            With the introduction of so much new technology across all industries, clients can accomplish more and become more efficient. However, with that same level of room for innovation comes more risk for challenges, especially when it comes to cybersecurity. Fisch Solutions offers strategic IT management for construction clients led by a team of experts who possess a deep knowledge of the ever-changing digital landscape and cybersecurity requirements/protocols. 

            

            How can implementing managed IT services help my construction organization or medical practice? 

            Working with an IT managed services provider works as a partnership–our team at Fisch Solutions works with a client in the construction industry and learns the unique business challenges, needs, and goals of that entity. Once we understand those factors, we can work as consultants to seek the best solutions for an organization.  

            

            Construction IT services hold great value for organizations in this industry–a client's internal team can now focus on business needs and innovation. IT services also allow for greater scalability within the organization, have access to 24/7 help versus only during regular business hours, and have a predictable monthly cost. In addition, outsourcing IT services help with cost savings, business continuity, and overall client experience. Internal teams can now focus on tasks associated with the planning and execution of projects and not be burdened with IT challenges, affecting several different areas of a construction client's workflow. 

            

            How can managed IT services help cut costs at my construction  organization or medical practice? 

            Choosing to work with a managed IT service provider like Fisch Solutions allows IT departments in the construction industry to be more productive without the burden of bandwidth challenges, outdated equipment, and archives that are difficult to access. In addition, new technology allows for mobile application use, such as wirelessly sending information to a field office. Data can then integrate easily into the company's central system for recordkeeping. Increased investment in IT in the construction industry also means more intelligent modeling, allowing teams to make more informed decisions about a project quicker than before. 

            

            In addition, customized solutions offered by an IT service provider can cut costs by optimizing a construction organization's IT environment. This includes boosting the bandwidth needed for IT capabilities, cloud storage, higher security, and excellent IT support and maintenance access. Outsourcing these needs and working with a partner that can optimize IT infrastructure improves productivity and functionality and cuts costs associated with lost time, outdated resources, and cybersecurity challenges. 

            

            What IT support do you offer for an organization in the construction industry? 

            Our team of IT experts understands the complexities of the role in IT in the construction industry. We offer excellent IT support in the following: comprehensive IT assessments, cybersecurity measures, Office 365 migration, RFP and purchasing services, mobile device management, and consulting needs to meet a client's business goals and challenges.

We offer on-site assistance, technical support, and remote support to ensure your IT infrastructure and needs are met to ensure client satisfaction and business productivity.

            Do you support software and applications typically used in the construction industry? 

            In the digital age, more construction organizations are turning to software and applications to help them optimize productivity, workflows, and overall client experience. This includes incorporating software and applications for project management, job site coordination, blueprints, document management, project efficiency, and estimating.  

            

            As construction companies introduce more and more software and applications to help streamline core functions and optimize patient experience, they also invite more challenges such as technical difficulties and cybersecurity needs. At Fisch Solutions, our IT experts understand how software and applications used in the construction industry are used and what precautions must be taken.

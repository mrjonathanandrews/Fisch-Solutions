            What are managed IT services? 

            Managed IT services allow an organization of any size to outsource information technology (IT) to an external Managed IT Services Provider. Working with a managed IT services provider means more time and resources to focus on the core functions of a healthcare organization or medical practice for healthcare clients. Outsourcing managed IT services also allows clients in the healthcare industry to focus on payment collection, optimizing the patient experience, and providing continuity of care.  

            

            A difference between an IT managed service provider and a traditional IT department is that the managed services provider makes strategic decisions regarding IT needs and proactively presents them to the client. In this model, the managed services provider provides solutions to the client, acting as a consultant to guide organizations to make the best choices possible regarding IT related to their unique business needs and goals. 

            

            An IT managed services provider's role in an organization is determined by many different factors, including the client industry, business needs and goals, current infrastructure, and any compliance/security measures specific to that industry. For example, for healthcare, clients will need to ensure their IT solutions are HIPAA compliant. 

            

            With the introduction of so much new technology across all industries, clients can accomplish more and become more efficient. However, with that same level of room for innovation comes more risk for challenges, especially when it comes to cybersecurity. Fisch Solutions offers strategic IT management for healthcare clients led by a team of experts who possess a deep knowledge of the ever-changing digital landscape and cybersecurity requirements/protocols. 

            

            How can implementing managed IT services help my healthcare organization or medical practice? 

            Working with an IT managed services provider works as a partnership–our team at Fisch Solutions works with a client in the healthcare industry and learns the unique business challenges, needs, and goals of that entity. Once we understand those factors, we can work as consultants to seek the best solutions for an organization.  

            

            Healthcare IT services hold great value for organizations in this industry–a client's internal team can now focus on business needs and innovation. IT services also allow for greater scalability within the organization, have access to 24/7 help versus only during regular business hours, and have a predictable monthly cost. In addition, outsourcing IT services help with cost savings, business continuity, and overall patient experience. Internal teams can now focus on tasks associated with patient care and not be burdened with IT challenges, which can affect several different areas of a healthcare client's workflow. 

            

            How can managed IT services help cut costs at my healthcare organization or medical practice? 

            Choosing to work with a managed IT service provider like Fisch Solutions allows IT departments in the healthcare industry, such as hospitals, to be more productive without the burden of bandwidth challenges, outdated equipment, and archives that are difficult to access. In addition, customized solutions offered by an IT service provider can cut costs by optimizing a healthcare organization's IT environment. This includes boosting bandwidth needed for IT capabilities (such as the video requirements for medical imaging or wireless medical equipment), cloud storage, higher security, and excellent IT support and maintenance access. Outsourcing these needs and working with a partner that can identify how to optimize IT infrastructure improves productivity and functionality and cuts costs associated with lost time, outdated resources, and cybersecurity challenges. 

            

            What IT support do you offer for an organization in the healthcare industry?

            Do you support software and applications typically used in the healthcare industry? 

            In the digital age, more healthcare organizations such as private medical practices, medical groups, hospitals, and more are turning to software and applications to help them optimize productivity, workflows, and overall patient experience and incorporating software and applications such as electronic health records (EHR software, medical database software, and medical billing software can help boost patient experience and continuity of care. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of healthcare providers are offering telemedicine visits. These visits use special telemedicine software for secure virtual appointments.

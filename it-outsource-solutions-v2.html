            <h2>What is IT Outsourcing? </h2>

            <p>According to recent data from <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/" target="_blank">Spiceworks'</a> Ziff Davis, because of Covid-19, businesses are changing their business plans:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>44% are increasing the pace of their digital transformation</li>
                <li>33% are tightening their security and risk governance management</li>
                <li>30% are developing additional training resources for remote workers</li>
                <li>36% are working on improving their IT operations and systems performance</li>
                <li>32% are planning to connect with employees through standardized, secure, and intuitive tools</li>
                <li>27% are polishing their current disaster recovery setup</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Is your business looking to do any of the following listed above? Almost all organizations were forced to rethink their overall technology strategy and IT infrastructure after COVID-19. More workplaces are adopting a remote or hybrid work model, which means more equipment and better infrastructure is necessary to support workers in order for core business functions to get done. Many companies are also moving into digital transformation, which, according to the Enterprises Project, is defined as "...the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. It’s also a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the status quo, experiment, and get comfortable with failure. Moving into digital transformation allows for a company to be more innovative."</p>

            <p>Many industries have felt this pressure to really rethink the strategy behind their IT and innovation, including hospitals and health systems, retail, nonprofits, and consumer financial services. IT outsourcing allows for organizations to use third-party service to handle some part of its business functions, allowing its internal IT department, as well as other departments and functions, to focus on other priorities.</p>

            <h2>What are the benefits of IT outsourcing?</h2>

            <p>There are several benefits to outsourcing IT for your organization, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cost savings</li>
                <li>Access to global talent</li>
                <li>Time savings</li>
                <li>Ability to upscale quicker</li>
                <li>Better workflow and productivity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cost savings with IT outsourcing</h2>

            <p>Many companies were affected financially by the COVID-19 pandemic, and looking for IT outsourcing can help with cost savings and effectiveness. By choosing to opt for IT outsourcing instead of continually investing in internal IT department initiatives, companies can recuperate some of the money they may have lost because of the pandemic. There are several ways that IT outsourcing makes sense financially for organizations: by outsourcing your company’s IT needs, you will have less internal team members to pay – and not just salaries, but also employee medical insurance, travel allowance, and pension plans.</p>

            <p>Choosing to invest in IT outsourcing also means less risk with talent acquisitions and retention – you don’t have to worry about team members leaving, especially after they’ve received training the company has paid for. By choosing to outsource, you only pay for the package you choose, and you don’t have to worry about investing in employee insurance, taxes, training, and other costs that can really add up.</p>

            <h2>Less workspace needed with IT outsourcing</h2>

            <p>Internal IT teams need the right equipment to do their job well, which can cost your organization a lot of money. Equipment needs include desktops, laptops, headsets, microphones, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phone systems, several types of software, printers, servers, drives, and more. Growing your internal IT team means having to invest in more space, equipment, and upgrading your IT infrastructure to help support all of your team members. When you choose to work with an outsourced IT team like Fisch Solutions to help take care of your IT needs for your business, you can save on these costs.</p>

            <h2>Access to global talent</h2>

            <p>Are you tired of spending money on talent acquisition to find the right candidates for your internal IT team? Are you finding great IT talent, but not someone who has the specific experience you are looking for? Working with Fisch Solutions allows for your organization to have access to a knowledgeable team who can help with all of your initiatives and help you reach your business goals. Our team has many years of experience and a deep knowledge of the ever-changing IT landscape. Our team comprises a diverse set of professionals who possess different, specialized knowledge and can help recommend the best solutions for your organization.</p>

            <h2>Time savings with IT outsourcing</h2>

            <p>Simply put, by offloading some or all IT initiatives and tasks to our team at Fisch Solutions allows your internal employees to spend their time on other core business functions, and allows them to be more efficient with their time and how they work to support overall business goals. This is especially true for internal IT teams that may struggle to get certain initiatives done because of bandwidth of team members, obstacles with cost and budgets, or issues with IT infrastructure that affect a team’s ability to get things done. If your internal team is struggling with this, choosing to work with a team that is outsourced means your organization can still achieve its goals as it relates to technology and innovation in a more cost-effective and time-efficient way.</p>

            <h2>Ability to upscale quicker</h2>

            <p>By having the help of an outsourced IT team to help your business take on new initiatives, your organization can take on new clients and grow in the number of services provided. This is all thanks to the cost savings, time savings, and knowledge that working with an outsourced IT team like Fisch Solutions can provide.</p>

            <h2>Better workflow and increased productivity</h2>

            <p>Working with an outsourced IT vendor like Fisch Solutions means your internal team can have the extra help with projects and initiatives it needs to get things done. This results in higher levels of productivity between the two teams for the organization overall. Also, an outsourced IT vendor can work on projects or be available for support after regular business hours, after an internal IT department has left for the workday, resulting in better workflow.</p>

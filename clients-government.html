            <p>Our team of business experts understands the importance of IT to assist the government sector with responsive services to citizens and assists with building stellar infrastructure and implementing/supporting the use of government applications. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted government agency operations changed the model of how employees work, including a shift to remote work. According to NextGov, "one survey found that over 80% of U.S. government officials believe their agency is not as technologically advanced as it needs to be to cope with new challenges and opportunities."</p> 

            <p>One way that government clients were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic was in regards to digital transformation. The term "digital transformation" refers to adopting technology to help improve efficiency, value, or innovation. Many government organizations were affected due to the need to have a rapid shift from an in-office infrastructure for work to one that supports an extensive network of remote workers. Since 2020, many government entities have seen the success of IT partnerships and digital transformation in teleworking, cybersecurity, and digital services.</p>

            <h2>What are managed IT services?</h2>

            <p>Managed IT services allow an organization of any size to outsource information technology (IT) to an external Managed IT Services Provider. Working with a managed IT services provider means more time and resources to focus on the core functions of a government organization and the ability to serve the public more effectively. Outsourcing managed IT services also allows clients in the government sector to focus on project management, security and compliance, and bid tracking.</p> 

            <p>A difference between an IT managed service provider and a traditional IT department is that the managed services provider makes strategic decisions regarding IT needs and proactively presents them to the client. In this model, the managed services provider provides solutions to the client, acting as a consultant to guide organizations to make the best choices regarding IT related to their unique business needs and goals.</p> 

            <p>An IT managed services provider's role in an organization is determined by many different factors, including the client industry, business needs and goals, current infrastructure, and any compliance/security measures specific to that industry. For example, for government entities, clients will need to ensure their IT solutions cover the intricacies, costs, and overlaps of governance requirements (such as HIPPA, GLBA, and FISMA).</p> 

            <p>With the introduction of so much new technology across all industries, clients can accomplish more and become more efficient. However, with that same level of room for innovation comes more risk for challenges, especially when it comes to cybersecurity. Fisch Solutions offers strategic IT management for government clients led by a team of experts who possess a deep knowledge of the ever-changing digital landscape and cybersecurity requirements/protocols.</p> 

            <h2>How can implement managed IT services help a government organization?</h2>

            <p>Implementing managed IT services in the government sector can help clients in this industry with a multitude of its core functions, such as:</p> 

            <ul>

                <li>Bid Tracking</li>
                <li>Estimating and take-off</li>
                <li>Project Management</li>
                <li>Accounting Systems</li>
                <li>Data Archiving</li>
                <li>Cloud File Sharing</li>
                <li>Remote Access</li>
                <li>Security and Compliance</li>

            </ul>

            <p>According to research by McKinsey and Co, within just the first eight weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., consumer and digital business adoption accelerated five years forward as more consumers turn to digital experiences when shopping, managing finances. More, it makes sense that individuals are also looking for more digital experiences when interacting with government services. Partnering with Fisch solutions can help government clients ensure they are being productive and efficient when providing services to the public.</p> 

            <p>In addition, a survey conducted by Accenture found that about two-thirds (64%) of people prefer to engage with a virtual agent if the government agency offers it. Having these digital options available for users allows them to interact with a government client outside of regular business hours and provides for a less time-consuming experience, which also boosts consumer satisfaction with the services offered.</p>  

            <p>The pandemic also highlighted the weaknesses of legacy systems that some government clients are still using and the need to modernize them. Data, AI tools, applications, and other forms of a more modern IT infrastructure allow for a higher quality experience for users and a stronger government client overall.</p> 

            <h2>How can managed IT services help cut costs at my government organization or medical practice?</h2> 

            <p>Choosing to work with a managed IT service provider like Fisch Solutions allows IT departments in the government sector to automate some of its processes, which can help cut costs. Many government clients struggle to make up for expenses associated with the pandemic, and automation allows for digital processes within government departments, agencies, and other clients to be done quicker and more efficiently. By investing in digital transformation as well, government clients can offer a better quality experience to users.</p>

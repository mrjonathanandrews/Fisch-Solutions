            <h2>What are VoIP phone systems?</h2> 

            <p>If you are looking into phone and communication systems for your business, you may think about VoIP solutions. More and more businesses are turning to VoIP to help them reach their business goals. If you’re unfamiliar with VoIP systems and have never used them before, you may ask yourself some questions to help try to understand if they are the right solutions for your business. VoIP phones do not use traditional twisted pair copper wire. Traditional phones use analog signals, while VoIP phones convert calls into digital signals. So what does that mean for your business? Since these types of phones convert signals into digital signals and work via internet connections, VoIP providers can offer more features to businesses to help them with their unique business needs. Some of these features include having a virtual receptionist, leaving voicemails on emails for team members, call forwarding, 3 digit dialing, and much more.</p>

            <p>As an organizational solution for a fully remote or hybrid workforce, VoIP phones are proving to be a crucial tool. VoIP phones are reliable, allow for higher-quality digital communication and are typically 40 to 80% less expensive than traditional landline phone services. If your company is looking for a way to save more money for its technology investment to help support core business functions, VoIP phones should be at the top of your list.</p>

            <h2>How VOIP phones can save your business money</h2> 

            <p>There are several ways that VoIP systems can help your organization save money. By choosing to use VoIP phones instead of traditional landlines, you can save 20 to 50% off your monthly phone bill. That is already a huge reduction in monthly expenses, and a VoIP system would also add several new features for your team members to use that traditional phones cannot offer. VoIP phones also allow for easier remote work ability by allowing management to keep track of worker status and making it easier for remote workers to take calls from anywhere.</p>

            <p>Implementing VoIP systems also leads to the reduction of real estate expenses by making remote work easier and more workable for a greater number of employees. The more employees that can work remotely, the less physical space your organization will require while getting the work it needs done. Because VoIP phones work over the internet, it makes work possible in places such as the home, the office, a cafe, and much more.</p>

            <p>By saving on real estate costs, companies can put a large percentage of their budget back into other initiatives that will get them closer to their overall goals for the year. One of the favorite features of VOIP phones is the ability to send voice mail messages to an email inbox. Again, this makes it easier for your remote work force to get its work done.</p>

            <h2>Other benefits of VoIP business plans:</h2> 

            <p>The ability to receive voicemails on a cell phone or in an email via VoIP phone systems makes it easier for employees to get in contact with a customer or client when needed. This allows your organization to offer better customer service. Having high-quality customer service and overall user experiences can lead to higher customer retention rates, higher revenue for the year, and easier customer acquisition. Having great customer service is a powerful tool for business development, and VoIP phones can help you get there.</p>

            <p>Choosing a VoIP system for your organization also allows for ease of service. Every user can have their own permissions which allows for easy management of voice greetings, access button controls, and much more. Maintenance costs are also much lower with VoIP phone systems when compared to traditional phone systems. Some VoIP business plans also support text messaging. This allows for employees to communicate with each other incurring no texting cost. This feature allows users to communicate easily with each other while on the phone to provide information to each other while they are on hold or speaking with someone on the phone, leading to higher rates of productivity and better customer service.</p>

            <p>Many organizations are choosing to go with VoIP business plans because more and more companies across all sectors are undergoing digital transformation. With a movement to more digital means of communication and doing work, and the movement away from using older analog technology, companies will end up spending more money on trying to keep traditional equipment running well and will likely run into issues such as availability of old parts. VoIP phone systems offer a way for employees to get their work done in a more timely manner, with increased productivity, and with much lower costs to the organization when compared to traditional phone lines.</p>

            <p>One last way that VoIP phones can benefit your business is by allowing for VoIP applications. Because VoIP phones do not require a physical desk phone for the number to work, service providers offer applications for devices such as smartphones and laptops, which leads to lower hardware costs. Your business can reduce the number of physical lines with VoIP phone systems, which give employees a virtual extension.</p>

            <p>VoIP phones require much less hardware when compared to traditional phone lines. VoIP phones are plugged directly into a router and connect to their service providers using the internet. This leaves more money in your organization’s pocket only having to use an existing internet connection. There is no need to buy additional hardware. This allows for the basic cost of regular and international calls to be reduced since VoIP places these calls via the Internet. As you can see, there are many ways that VoIP phone systems can help your organization cut costs and get more work done.</p>

            <h2>Are VoIP phones for business reliable alternatives to a traditional landline?</h2>

            <p>Many organizations are asking, are VoIP phones for my business a reliable alternative to a traditional landline? Sure, there are a lot of features that VoIP phone systems offer employees—but can we rely on them in the same way we do traditional landlines?</p>

            <p>VoIP phones are incredibly reliable. If an organization has high-speed internet, their employees will experience high-quality voice calls with 99.9% connection uptime. Organizations can add a layer of protection by having a backup power source in case they face a power outage to keep the connection uptime high.</p>

            <p>So the short answer to this question is: VoIP phone systems are as reliable as the internet connection an organization has. By investing in a great wireless network solution, you can have high-speed internet with very few connection issues. Working with a wireless solution provider like Fisch Solutions also means you will have access to great customer service in case there are connection issues, and a highly skilled team that can install VoIP phone systems that offer employees a ton of different features that landlines simply cannot.</p>

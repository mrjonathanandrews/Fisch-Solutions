            <h1>Cloud / Internet of Things (IoT) / Wireless Solutions</h1>
            <p>Hudson Valley, New York</p>

            <h2>What are cloud IT solutions?</h2>
            
            <p>Cloud IT solutions allow for data from your organization to be housed externally, making it not only easier for employees to access data from multiple places but also more secure than keeping information housed internally. Many companies are looking to cloud-based solutions following the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for many companies to adopt a hybrid or strictly remote model for its employees. To help employees have access to data from wherever they are working, cloud-based solutions offer secure data storage that also helps cut costs to an organization.</p>

            <p>Businesses that try to house data internally end up spending tons of money on the equipment needed, whereas cloud storage not only cuts down on the physical space needed to house all this information, but also offers a much more cost-effective option. By working with a service like Fisch Solutions, which offers excellent cloud based IT solutions to organizations in Hudson Valley, New York, you can find which cloud-based option is the best for your business: SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), or IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).</p>  

            <h3>What are IoT solutions?</h3> 

            <p>IoT stands for “the internet of things,” a complex concept where physical objects are embedded together through software and other technology that allows for the exchange of data with several systems over the internet or another communication network. According to <a href="https://www.iotforall.com/" target="_blank">IoT For All</a>, “An IoT Solution is a seamlessly integrated bundle of technologies, including many sensors, that organizations can purchase to solve an organizational problem and/or create new organizational value.”</p>

            <h3>What are Wireless Solutions?</h3>

            <p>Wireless solutions enable your office or warehouse to connect to your network outside of the traditional boundaries of data cabling. By using a wireless system, you can connect multiple networks from different areas of your campus or between several buildings. High-powered Wireless Solutions allow for your employees to get more work done at a quicker rate, boosting productivity for your overall organization. Wireless solutions allow for more remote work and easier remote access to data, especially after the change in workplace structure to a remote or hybrid model following Covid-19.</p> 

            <p>Several types of businesses can use wireless solutions. These include small and medium businesses like shared office spaces, bars, restaurants, cafes, small shops, kiosks, hotels, hospitality companies, boutique shops, and entrepreneurs who own their own business. Large companies can also benefit from using wireless solutions in order to help them have a competitive advantage in their industry. Access to information, especially in an environment where many employees are working remotely, is crucial for an organization to reach its business goals. For large organizations that have multiple offices and employees working in different areas of the country or the world, it is crucial for their wireless network to be optimized for each location. Investing in Wireless Solutions allows for your company to increase revenue, improve productivity, have higher levels of cybersecurity, and use more data, analytics, and business intelligence to gain a competitive edge and to explore more innovative business strategies.</p>

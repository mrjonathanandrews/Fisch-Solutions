            What are cloud IT solutions? 

            Cloud IT solutions allow for data from your organization to be housed externally, making it not only easier for employees to access data from multiple places but also more secure than keeping information housed internally. Many companies are looking to cloud-based solutions following the COVID-19 pandemic and the way many companies have adopted a hybrid or strictly remote model for its employees. To help employees have access to data from wherever they are working, cloud-based solutions offer secure data storage that also helps cut costs to an organization. 

            Businesses that try to house data internally end up spending tons of money on the equipment needed, whereas cloud storage not only cuts on the physical space needed to house all this information, but also offers a much more cost-effective option. By working with a service like Fisch Solutions, which offers excellent cloud based IT solutions to organizations in Hudson Valley, New York, you can find which cloud-based option is the best for your business: SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), or IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).

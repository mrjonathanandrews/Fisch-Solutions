            <p>Law firms across the Hudson Valley are striving to meet an elite security standard on digital
            platforms. A managed IT service can serve as a long-term solution for law firms to maintain a
            high standard of technological proficiency and protection in this age of cybercriminal activity.
            Fisch Solutions offers a company constant security as well as expert knowledge and customer
            service.</p>
            
            <p>Managed IT services allow an organization of any size to outsource information technology (IT)
            to an external Managed IT Services Provider. Working with a managed IT services provider
            means more time and resources for a law firm to focus on the development of each individual
            case. Outsourcing managed IT services also allows clients in the industry to focus on the
            important advice and information offered to them by their attorney.</p>
            
            <p>A difference between an IT Managed Services Provider and a traditional IT department is that the
            Managed Services Provider makes strategic decisions regarding IT needs and proactively
            presents them to the client. In this model, the Managed Services Provider provides solutions to
            the client, acting as a consultant to guide organizations to make the best choices possible
            regarding IT related to their unique business needs and goals.</p>
            
            <p>An IT Managed Services Provider’s role in an organization is determined by many different
            factors, including the client industry, business needs and goals, current infrastructure, and any
            compliance/security measures specific to that industry. In the legal realm specifically, document
            management, email encryption, time tracking, billing contacts, case calendars and more have
            resulted in a greater need for IT infrastructure security.</p>
            
            <p>With the introduction of so much new technology across all industries, clients can accomplish
            more and become more efficient. However, along with the room for innovation comes
            more risk, especially when it comes to cybersecurity challenges. Fisch Solutions offers
            strategic IT management for law firms to combat these risks with constant protection.</p>
            
            <p>Implementing managed IT services can be beneficial for a law firm in many ways. First and
            foremost, a lack of updated IT modifications can create major risks for a law firm’s clients and
            practice. An IT Managed Services Provider such as Fisch Solutions will recommend quality security
            protection and IT management processes to keep all operating systems and applications up to
            date. Managed IT services help a law firm to reach compliance with the continually shifting
            government guidelines when it comes to software updates. A legal company must meet
            compliance for data security. Without compliance, documents will not be properly stored in the
            safest and most effective way.</p>
            
            <p>Legal IT support has also become a top concern of legal firms due to document collaboration,
            video conferencing and mobile devices. The consequences of a cyber security incident in a work
            environment with such a large amount of sensitive information being shared on-the-go could be
            detrimental. It is not uncommon for an attorney to need to access information and documents
            outside of the office. A managed IT service will ensure that this out-of-office access is secure.
            This managed IT service will help improve the mobility of your team’s data by putting systems
            into place that allow your team to securely access data anywhere they have an internet
            connection.</p>
            
            <p>With budgeting and prioritization of cybersecurity, law firms can rely on managed IT services to
            ensure the confidentiality of this information. One of the most practical routes for a legal
            organization to take regarding cyber security includes a firewall, advanced endpoint protection,
            and security measures around email and data storage. Fisch Solutions can ensure better and
            easier protection of operations and data, regardless of where the information is being accessed.
            Cyber security training is an important piece of keeping your business safe from phishing, CEO
            fraud, malware, and efforts to steal data. As law firms rely on the confidentiality, integrity and
            accessibility of its data, the lack of security awareness can lead to severe income loss and
            reputational damage. So, it’s imperative for law firms to partner with a right IT Managed Services
            Provider to have a protected journey.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, fewer than 60% of law firms have a “formal” IT budget, and 25% of law firms have no
            IT security policies <span>Source: https://www.copycei.com/industries/law-firms/</span>.
            Law firms hold bulk capacities of sensitive and confidential data of their firms, employees, and
            clients. Without the protection of Managed IT Support, law firms are a lucrative target for
            cybercriminals. Any company storing such valuable data is likely to be a victim of hackers, which
            is difficult to prevent without professional IT assistance. Many law firms are also preferring a
            IT Managed Services Provider over an internal team due to cost-effectiveness.</p>
            
            <p>Not only does a managed IT service provide access to leading cybersecurity technologies, but it
            is a more affordable route for businesses due to cost savings in terms of floor space, human resources, and
            infrastructure. Instead of having several IT experts on staff regularly, Fisch Solutions allows for
            24/7 help when needed. Having IT experts in office every day may seem helpful but is typically
            unnecessary. If there isn’t a constant flow of IT mishaps to resolve, this person may have little
            to no work to do some days. The company is then paying a staff member to be there that may
            not need to be. Additionally, these extra employees are not only getting their hourly wage, but
            are also getting health insurance, benefits, and equipment costs all at the expense of the firm.
            Fisch solutions can eliminate much of these costs while simultaneously providing faster and
            more efficient protection.</p>
            
            <p>Implementing a managed IT service is also a great opportunity for overall enhanced
            productivity. IT hiccups are inevitable in any organization but should not directly halt operations.
            Fisch solutions will help minimize company downtime by establishing redundancies, security
            measures, and disaster plans that shield your organization from issues or threats that impact
            productivity. Issues such as server failures and slow internet will no longer negatively impact the
            team’s ability to work efficiently, as these issues will be resolved rapidly while the internal team
            is still working. The additional mobility and IT support also allows the team to make the most of
            their workday by working when and where they need to. Workers will be able to resume work
            from remote locations at home or with clients. This productivity upkeep results in protection of
            profit. Fisch Solutions can ensure this protection to maximize the productivity of every workday.</p>
            
            <p>Fisch Solutions employs a help desk to effectively keep track of all IT issues. A legal help desk is
            an interactive tool used to meet customer needs. When a customer or client sends in a request
            for assistance, that request is funneled into a system that allocates the ticket to a support
            member from our team. This ticket is tracked, assigned, and supervised to guarantee quality
            communication with the client is met. In a law firm without a set system, clients can be
            overlooked or delayed in communication. This creates a work environment that is frustrating
            and difficult for customers. Managed IT services eradicate these frustrations by using this
            structured and logical system. This system also allows the client the chance to express their
            level of contentment after the issue is resolved. The help desk is a great tool for reliable
            communication when it comes to client concerns.</p>
